# Quaranteam-APP
A team project using c# with .Net core and SQL.
To complete this project we have been briefed to use Dapper for data access and Swagger generation for all http methods.

We are required to cover these areas when completing this project: 
Frameworks: ASP.NET Core, MVC
Basic route setup
Data Access: Dapper
Interfaces
Validation
Unit Testing
Databases: Initial Setup, Tables and Stored procedures, Basic SQL
C#
API Documentation (Swagger)
JSON based
URI versioning (extended task)

-------------------------------------
Completed so far.


1. Basic frameworks, basic route set-up was quite easy since we have covered this a few times previously in lessons.
2. Initial Setup of Database for Movies API was done on day one, including table. Most of the stored procedures and 
basic SQL coding was completed over a couple of days in week 1. We have a couple more to do excluding extension tasks.
3. Data access has been added to the file and can connect to SQL server.
4. Swagger has been installed and configured to start-up page and connects to server. We have completed 2x GET requests and 1x POST request. They are json based.
5. We have also started to use interfaces. 


Still to complete.

1. Interfaces.
2. Validation.
3. Unit Testing.
4. URI versioning.
5. Further extensions to the project which will be done in SQL. 


**UPDATED

Interface has been added IMoveRepository.
Partial Validation has been completed - Still needs some work.
We have a User Model and a DB to hold user data.
Some test files have been completed in a seperate file and will be added to this project today.
